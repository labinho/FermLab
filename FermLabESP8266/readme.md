This sketch has the purpose to act as an template device for further development. It performs following actions:
<<<<<<< HEAD
 1. connect to your WiFi
 2. fetch current time from NIST server and store it as current timestamp
 3. blink builtin LED every 2 seconds and update time

## Prerequisites
Before you actually can use this sketch, you have to compile a file. Within the [Nanopb repository](https://github.com/nanopb/nanopb) you can find the [nanopb_generator.py](https://github.com/nanopb/nanopb/blob/d7b99225ecf8a830712787ae5141242e4e465dd0/generator/nanopb_generator.py) in **python**, which compiles a **Sparkplug B protobuf** file into a **c** and corresponding **h** file.
